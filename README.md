# SPH Fluid Simulator
 
## About this Program

This is a SPH(Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) based fluid simulation where the position of each particle is updated on a frame by frame basis according to the Navier-Stokes equation of motion for fluids. The physics computations are done single threaded on the CPU and visualized via OpenGL.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

2. From the root of the repository, 
    ```
    xcopy res build\Release\res /E /I
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32 ..
    ```

3. Navigate to /build and build the project using release build either in Visual Studio or in terminal via MSBuild.

4. Run build/release/main.exe

## Future Work

* Lots of numerically instable regimes in parameter space.
* Figure out GPU parallelization methods in order to improve framerate
* Background density parameter is incredibly buggy; particles experience clumping when background density is non zero.
* Clean up code
